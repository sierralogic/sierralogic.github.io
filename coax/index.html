    <h1>Coax</h1>
    <strong>Coax</strong> is an OpenAPI routing Clojure library to generate and route REST API via
    canonical OpenAPI file.

    The OpenAPI REST API definition format has become a standard in REST API
    development.

    In the past, the REST API may be completely defined in the OpenAPI definition
    file(s), but the HTTP method/endpoint routing has been done independently of
    the OpenAPI definition file(s) which may result in the actual routing of the
    REST API becoming out-of-sync with the OpenAPI definition/document file(s).

    Coax is a library that allows for Clojure REST API development that never is
    out-of-sync with the OpenAPI definition/documentation file(s) by adding a
    single `handler` key in the endpoint/method definition that links the
    endpoint/method to a Clojure handler function identifier.

    <h2>How to Use Coax</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Add `coax` dependency to the Compojure-based project.</li>
        <li>Define the REST API in OpenAPI file(s) with examples and response/request
            schemas somewhere in the `resources` folder
            (e.g. `resources/private/api/openapi.v1.json`)</li>
        <li>Add `handler` function identifiers as strings
            (`package.subp1.subp2.handler.function-name`)in the OpenAPI file(s).</li>
        <li>In the initialization of your project, make call(s) to
            `coax/import-openapi-definition-file`with the `resource` path as the string
            argument.</li>
        <li>Add `(coax/api-compojure-route)` in your routes.</li>
        <li>Start your Compojure service.</li>
        <li>Use `curl` or another REST client and test your REST API handlers defined
           in the OpenAPI file(s).</li>
    </ul>
